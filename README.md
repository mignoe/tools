Infinite java compiler is a simple tool that allows working and debugging a java file at the same time.

It compiles every 3 seconds the .java file, showing any errors found by the compiler.

It also allows the user to simply execute the program after saving (and waiting the script compile the update file).

How to use:
execute it with $bash <directory path to infinite_compile.sh> <directory path to your_program.java>

It will take your terminal pane to keep compiling your file. To end it just press ctrl simultaneously with c (ctrl + c)
